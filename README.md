Bamazon, a Walkthrough

Bamazon is a command terminal/bash storefront program.  When running the program, the user will be shown a selection of items and their price.  The user will be asked to select an item for purchase, followed by a prompt for quantity.  A successful transaction will inform the user, display the transaction total, update the inventory, and end the connection.  An unsuccessful transaction will inform the user, display the items for sale and repeat prompts.
